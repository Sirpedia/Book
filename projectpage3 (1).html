<h1>The color i chose for the background of my slides is black </h1>
<h2> i chose this color because black has a mysterious feel to it, and the book is a mystery book.</h2>
<h3> i chose the images because the arrows represent the change in dynamics and relationships throughout the book.</h3>
<h4> i chose the two quotes to show the change in Ivy and Mateos relationship. At first they appeared to be "rivals", however later on we can see them helping and relying on each other.</h4>
